# Defect-Scanner

## Welcome to the Framework for Applying Language Models and Deep Learning in Software Vulnerability Detection
Defect-Scanner is designed to enable applying various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep learning (DL) models in detecting vulnerabilities in pieces of software (mainly in C/C++). It supports (but is not limited to) two different word embedding techniques including Word2Vec and CodeBERT in tokenizing source code into vector form, which can be used in training and testing various DL models (CNN, RNN, Transformers, and BiLSTM are available for experiments).
## How to run Defect-Scanner
Install all dependencies included in `requirements.txt` using `pip` (pip3 is recommended)
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Navigate to the corresponding directory of `CodeGadgets` or `SeVCs` according to the data type that you want to work with.
Read the `README.MD` file in each directory for more instructions.
